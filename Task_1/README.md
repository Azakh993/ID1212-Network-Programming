# Laboratory 1: Sockets & Threads

## Task

- Create a socket-based chat system using Java.
- Implement two classes: `ChatServer` and `ChatClient`.
- Requirements:
  - Clients can exit the chat without crashing the server.
  - Handle server downtime gracefully.
  - Allow the server and clients to run on separate JVMs.

## Extra Task

- Install a network sniffer (e.g., Wireshark).
- Record chat traffic and answer questions about TCP headers and flags.

## Useful Classes

- `java.net.Socket`
- `java.net.ServerSocket`

## Note

- If working in pairs, only one should upload the code to avoid plagiarism.
- Upload the code before or during the presentation.
