# Project

## Project Description

You will undertake a project that you define yourself. One example of such a project could be developing a queue system similar to [https://queue.csc.kth.se](https://queue.csc.kth.se) (the current system was developed by a student in a similar course). The project will have specific scope requirements, but it will also be graded based on the technologies and techniques you use.

### Grading Criteria

The grading for the project may include bonus points for incorporating certain technologies or techniques. Some examples of what might earn bonus points include:

- Implementation of RESTful web services
- Non-blocking sockets
- Use of frameworks other than Spring MVC
- Any other creative and innovative proposals (in cases where the task is sufficiently open-ended)

Please note that using a different programming language or technology other than Java, such as Node.js, is allowed but will not result in bonus points.

## Note

- Detailed project requirements and grading criteria will be provided later in the course.
- Ensure that your project proposal aligns with the course's guidelines and expectations.
