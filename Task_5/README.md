# Laboration 5: Spring MVC

## Task Description

In this lab, the primary task is to create the same quiz application as in Lab 4 but using the Spring framework. Much of the existing code can be reused, but now you should use `DispatcherServlet` as the Front Controller and then forward the requests to your own controller.

### Extra Task

Use JavaMail to send the quiz results to the player after the latest game session.

## Note

- If working in pairs, only one should upload the code to avoid plagiarism.
- Upload the code before or during the presentation.
