# Laboration 3: SSL/TLS-encrypted Sockets

## Extra Task: Implement Encryption for the Number Guessing Game

### Task Description

Modify the number guessing game from Lab 2 to use encryption, and verify that a commercial web browser (not your own hack) can connect to the game (https://localhost) and play it. Since the encryption is set up on the *server* side, you will need to change the game to use encryption with a certificate. You can use the keytool to create a self-signed certificate.

### Requirements

In addition to the implementation part (which largely follows standard procedures), you/your team should be able to explain how signing and verification with a Certificate Authority (CA) works.

## Note

- If working in pairs, only one should upload the code to avoid plagiarism.
- Upload the code before or during the presentation.
